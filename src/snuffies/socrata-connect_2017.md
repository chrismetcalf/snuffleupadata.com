This year, Socrata Connect was held in DC, bringing together all of Socrata's customers for a two day summit followed by a data camp. It is here that our wonderful customers are able to share their experiences, challenges, and insight into how their city or organization is utilizing data and Socrata to better understand the problems and challenges they face and to better serve their constituents.
