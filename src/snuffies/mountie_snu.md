Mountie Snu was excited to attend the Canadian Open Data Summit this year! The summit was hosted in the city of Edmonton, a long time customer of Socrata's. Both the City of Edmonton and Strathcona County are considered leaders in making government data open and accessible. Attendees were able to hear about others' experiences and share ideas about how best to continue making open data a reality.
