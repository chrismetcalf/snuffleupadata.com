Taking after the 2017 World Games in Wroclaw, Poland, Socrata held its own version in its Seattle and DC offices. With events such as sumo wrestling, chair rowing, orienteering, and more, the Socrata World Games offered a fun outlet for Socratizens to exercise their might and work with their teammates. Here, Snu is rocking a gnome hat, as worn by performers from the real World Games opening ceremony, and a World Games medal as Snu is always a champion!
