Snufflemore’s hit song “Data Shop” includes lyrics like, “Hello, hello, thank my local government. PDFs are nothing, open data hella bent,” “Thank your government for making data free to guzzle. ‘Cause right now I’m solving mad complicated civic puzzles. I’m at my desk you can find me on the portal. I’m that genius searching on the portal,” and “I’m gonna make some maps. I Got KML files, raw data. I’m, I’m, I’m buildin’, solving city issues– This is civic awesome.” The song has sold over 6 million copies in the US, and Snufflemore is a verified star.
