Snuthulhu was created as we enter the time of year where the veil between ours and His dark dimension thins. We thought it would be wise to honor him, lest he chose this moment to wake from his watery slumber and again enslave us in the darkness (and because the name works so well). Snutchulhu is here for Halloween at Socrata!
