Every year, Socrata throws a big holiday bash to celebrate the year and welcome the next. The theme for the 2016 holiday party was good old, classic Rock 'n Roll. Snu always likes to have a good time so he invited four special guests to come and celebrate: Jimmi Snuffrix, Kurt Snubain, Snuffl Rose, and Snuffy Lauper. The four helped to keep the party rockin' late into the evening!
