To go hand-in-hand with the 2016 Summer Olympic Games, Socrata held its very own office olympics. Socratizens from the DC and Seattle offices, along with remote folks, formed teams of 10 to compete in myriad individual and team challenges. A highlight of the summer, many laughs were had and good memories formed, all in the name of being crowned Socrata olympic champions!
